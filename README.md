## Projects
- <p> Project 1: web application for teachers from Skyeng
**<p> What had to be done**: To implement it, it was necessary to: select the required type of testing, explain your choice, work with test documentation, enter test cases and prioritize them, test the API, enter checks into the TMS and the found bugs into the bug tracking system , generate reports in TMS.<p>
<ol>
   
   <li>Task №1: It was necessary to test a new function - “Personal Event”. This feature allowed the teacher to add a "personal event."</li>
      Teachers can use "personal events" for their own meetings.</li>
      They serve as a reminder that the teacher has something planned for that time</li>
    <li>Task №2: Test this functionality so that it works properly, as written in the project documentation, and does not interfere with the performance of other functions.</li>
</ol>

**<p>How I solved it**: I solved this problem based on the documentation. As the solution progressed, I created test cases, checklists, and ultimately created bug reports in the bug tracking system.
It all came down to the fact that not all functionality worked properly. which was described in the documentation.<p>
  
  
   >[Project](https://qazedctgbujm.atlassian.net/l/cp/smCnmmwB)</a>
  
  **<p>Conclusion**
 
 - The conclusion for the project looks like this. From testing the “Personal Events” functionality, the following conclusions can be drawn: “functional testing” showed that the system is working properly, but there are problems that affect its normal operation. Despite the fact that the product has undergone changes, errors in its performance remain. This can be seen even after “Regression testing”. Based on these data, we can conclude that the product was not ready for release.<p>

- <p> Project 2: Testing a mobile application from Skyeng
**<p> What needed to be done**: Testing two sections “Situations” and “Video Practice” in the Skyeng mobile application. Testing took place in a team, everyone took part in testing.<p>
<ol>

   <li>Task #1: It was necessary to test the functionality - “Situations” and “Video Practice”.</li>
    <li>Task #2: Test this functionality so that it works properly, as written in the project documentation, and does not interfere with the performance of other functions.</li> 
</ol> 

**<p>How I solved it**: I solved this problem based on the documentation. As the solution progressed, I created checklists, created bug reports in the bug tracking system as a result.
It all came down to the fact that not all functionality worked properly. which was described in the documentation.<p>

  >[Project](https://www.notion.so/58443d1afbb648e88175bf8ad10d3d34)

**<p>Conclusion**
   
 - Based on the testing results, we can conclude that the functionality of the “Situations” and “Video Practice” sections **is not ready for release**, since half of the defects found have a high severity and priority (S2 and higher, P2 and higher).
  - We invite the product to discuss adjusting the requirements in accordance with [document](https://www.notion.so/943858b15e9f4c4a82a57e271f01990d?pvs=21) on testing requirements.
  - It is necessary to check the sections with their layouts, since some of the names of the elements differ from the names given in the requirements.
  - The developers are currently working on 10 defects, of which 3 are with the Severity attribute Blocker, 1 is Critical - 2 Major.
  - Of the planned 109 inspections, 109 were carried out, of which 97 were passed; failed - 12.
